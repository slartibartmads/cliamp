# Plex Media Server

cliamp can stream music directly from your Plex Media Server, giving you access to your full Plex music library — including any library served by PlexAmp. Streaming uses the same Plex HTTP API that official Plex clients use; no extra software is required.

## Prerequisites

- Plex Media Server running and reachable on your network (or remotely)
- At least one music library configured in Plex
- Your `X-Plex-Token` (see below)

## Finding your X-Plex-Token

1. Open Plex Web in a browser and sign in
2. Browse to any item in your music library
3. Click the **···** menu → **Get Info** → **View XML**
4. In the URL of the XML page, copy the value of the `X-Plex-Token` query parameter

Alternatively, follow the [official Plex guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

## Configuration

Add a `[plex]` section to `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml`:

```toml
[plex]
url   = "http://192.168.1.10:32400"
token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `url` | Base URL of your Plex Media Server, including port (default `32400`) |
| `token` | Your `X-Plex-Token` for authentication |

If you access Plex remotely via `app.plex.tv`, you can still use a direct server URL if your server has remote access enabled, or use your server's `plex.direct` URL from the Plex Web address bar.

## Usage

Once configured, **Plex** appears as a provider in the cliamp TUI alongside Radio, Navidrome, Spotify, etc.

The provider exposes your music library as a flat list of albums, labelled:

```
Artist — Album Title (Year)
```

Select an album to load its tracks, then play as normal.

To start cliamp with Plex as the default provider:

```bash
cliamp --provider plex
```

Or set it persistently in config:

```toml
provider = "plex"
```

## How it works

cliamp calls the Plex HTTP API to enumerate your music libraries and albums. When you select an album, it fetches the track list and constructs authenticated streaming URLs of the form:

```
http://<server>:32400/library/parts/<partID>/<timestamp>/file.<ext>?X-Plex-Token=<token>
```

These are direct file-serve URLs — Plex serves the original file without transcoding, and cliamp's existing HTTP streaming pipeline handles playback. All formats supported by cliamp (MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, OPUS, WAV, etc.) work as long as the original file format is one of them.

## Known limitations

- **No scrobbling** — play counts are not reported back to Plex
- **No playlist write-back** — cliamp cannot create or modify Plex playlists
- **Token is long-lived** — store it carefully; it grants full access to your Plex account
- **Album list is flat** — no artist drill-down; search by scrolling or using cliamp's search
- **No Plex playlists** — only library albums are exposed (Plex user-created playlists are not yet surfaced)
